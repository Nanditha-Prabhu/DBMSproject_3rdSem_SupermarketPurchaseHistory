# DBMSproject_3rdSem_SupermarketPurchaseHistory
We were given a task to create a database and perform some operations on it. In our project we used XAMPP server and Supermarket database. Inside that 
we had created different tables so that we can manage the database efficiently. For purchase history retrieval we had created a simple web page where
you input the invoice ID and all the details about the purchase will be displayed.
The snapshots of the information retrieval and all other details are included in the report.

How to run connection.php in your system?
  You must install XAMPP server. 
  Go to htdocs folder inside XAMPP folder in the file explorer and store the file inside a folder.
  Start Apache, Mysql servers in XAMPP control panel.
  Open your web browser and type localhost/<foldername>
  Then click on connection.php
  Thats it!
